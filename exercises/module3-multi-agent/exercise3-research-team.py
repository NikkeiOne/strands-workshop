# Exercise 3: Research Team - Multi-Agent Collaboration
# Module 3 - Multi-Agent Systems

"""
Learning Objectives:
1. Understand multi-agent orchestration patterns
2. Implement specialized agents working together
3. Practice task decomposition and result aggregation
4. Experience the power of collaborative AI systems

This exercise demonstrates the Orchestrator-Worker pattern where:
- A coordinator agent manages the overall workflow
- Specialized agents handle specific aspects of research
- Results are aggregated into a comprehensive final report

# üéì Learning Exercises:
# 
# 1. **Modify Agent Roles**: Try changing the system prompts to create
#    different specialist roles (e.g., Technical Expert, Market Researcher)
#
# 2. **Add New Agents**: Create additional specialists like:
#    - Competitive Intelligence Agent
#    - Risk Assessment Agent  
#    - Financial Analysis Agent
#
# 3. **Experiment with Tools**: Add more tools to different agents:
#    - Give the researcher access to specific APIs
#    - Add data visualization tools to the analyst
#    - Include planning tools for the strategist
#
# 4. **Parallel Processing**: Modify the workflow to run some agents
#    in parallel instead of sequentially
#
# 5. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for when agents
#    fail or provide incomplete responses
#
# 6. **Quality Control**: Add a quality assurance agent that reviews
#    and validates the work of other agents
