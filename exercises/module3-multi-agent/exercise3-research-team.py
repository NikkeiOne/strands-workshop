# Exercise 3: REAL Research Team - Multi-Agent Orchestration (AGENTS-AS-TOOLS PATTERN)
# Arc II: Multi-Agent Orchestration - using Strands SDK patterns

"""
🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
1. Implement agents-as-tools pattern for multi-agent coordination
2. Create specialized agents that agents can call as tools using @tool decorator
3. Build intelligent task routing where agents invoke other agents
4. Handle production-grade agent-to-agent communication with MCP tools


🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (Agents-as-Tools Pattern):
- Orchestrator Agent: Uses specialized agent tools for coordination
- @tool wrapped agents: Researcher, Analyst, Fact Checker, QA Specialist
- Agent-to-agent communication: Orchestrator calls agents as tools
- True data flow: Each agent builds on previous agent's actual output
- Production coordination: Agents deciding which other agents to invoke
- MCP Integration: Uses DuckDuckGo search and Sequential Thinking tools

🚀  IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES (Agents-as-Tools):
- @tool decorator wraps agents as callable functions
- Orchestrator agent intelligently routes to specialist agents
- Real agent outputs become inputs to other agents
- Production-grade multi-agent coordination patterns
- Genuine collaborative problem-solving (not workflow simulation)
- MCP tools for real web search and advanced reasoning

        You have access to specialist agent tools that perform REAL work with MCP integration:
        
        - research_specialist: Uses DuckDuckGo search to gather current information
        - analysis_specialist: Uses sequential thinking for systematic analysis
        - factcheck_specialist: Uses DuckDuckGo search to verify claims
        - quality_specialist: Assesses research quality and completeness
        
        Coordination strategy based on complexity:
        - SIMPLE: Use research_specialist only
        - STANDARD: Use research_specialist + analysis_specialist
        - COMPLEX: Use research_specialist + analysis_specialist + factcheck_specialist  
        - EXPERT: Use all specialist agents for comprehensive research
        
        The specialist agents will perform actual work with MCP tools:
        - Real web searches using DuckDuckGo MCP integration
        - Systematic analysis using sequential thinking MCP tools
        - Genuine fact-checking against multiple web sources
        - Real quality assessment with comprehensive metrics
        
        Coordinate intelligently and build comprehensive findings from the specialist agents' work.
        Each agent's output becomes input for the next agent in your coordination strategy.
